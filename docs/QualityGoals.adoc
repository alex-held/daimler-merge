= Quality Goals

This section contains the quality goals that I selected to guide my design decisions while solving the link:./Task.adoc[Task].

Functional Correctness:: The algorithm works merges all overlapping intervals and returns the expected result.

Installability:: The project **needs** to be build by a third party, and I am unaware of their system environment.

Testability:: Since algorithms tend to get messy, it is especially important, that a descriptive test suite documents the code.

Analyzability:: I almost always prefer simplicity above performance. However, 'Performance efficiency' is still important, but if I need to choose between Performance and maintainability, I choose maintainability.
